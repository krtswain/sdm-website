                        The Department of Mechanical Engineering started in the year 1979 has been accredited by the NBA (National Board of Accreditation) thrice. In the year 2018, department has been accredited by NBA under Tier I Category. In line with the vision of department, the department has a UG program with 120+ intake in mechanical Engineering with a set of robust core courses accompanied by industrially relevant, current electives like Robotics, Aircraft Structure Design, AFD, CFD etc. In the year 2003 a unique PG program Engineering Analysis and Design was started which has been well accepted by the industry and institutes of higher learning. The autonomous status in the year 2007 and the TEQIP 1.2 has enabled to setup state of the art facilities to impart specialized training in the areas of Hydraulics, Pneumatics, Sensorics, Mechatronics & Robotics though an MOU with Bosch Rexroth (India) Ltd., which comes under the department. A strong network with industries like Spicer India, TELCON, Miven-Mayfran Conveyor, INFOSYS, HAL, ARAI-Pune, NIEF-Bombay etc., helps in overall development of the students. The department has 29 competent faculty members with requisite qualifications including 12 Ph. D. holders and 26 non-teaching staff. A number of funded projects are undertaken by the department sponsored by various funding agencies like VGST, DST, ARDB, DRDO, etc. Presently a total of 61 lakhs funded projects are underway.

The department has an established research center under VTU, Belagavi, wherein research works in the areas of Robotics, Advanced Machining, Biofuel and Sustainable Technologies, Composites, CFD are being under taken. A total of 18 Ph. D scholars are doing their research work in the department. Also the department is having MOU with TATA Technology regarding Distant Ready Engineers program where in the students are undergoing training. The department is also having MOU with Spicer India Pvt. Ltd. Dharwad for AMIE and IIIE, University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS) to facilitate interdisciplinary research. The department has been contributing richly to the growth and development of the institution and its stakeholders.
